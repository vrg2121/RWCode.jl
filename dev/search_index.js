We model the details of the combined production and transmission network of electricity (“the grid”) that determine the supply and losses of energy in space. The local rate of clean energy adoption depends on learning-by-doing, the global electricity and trade network, and regional comparative advantage in renewable resources. We use the model to measure the aggregate and spatial implications of clean growth. We find that the world’s power system is likely to be dominated by renewables by 2040 in a range of scenarios, with substantial welfare gains, even in the absence of policy. Incorporating policy, we find that the US Inflation Reduction Act significantly accelerates renewable uptake, and generates substantial economic benefits. In addition, planned grid improvements lower prices substantially in many areas of the US, justifying their cost of construction.},\n}","category":"page"},{"location":"quickstart/#Quick-Start","page":"Quick Start","title":"Quick Start","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"quickstart/","page":"Quick Start","title":"Quick Start","text":"This tutorial is for those already familiar with Julia, Git, Docker and / or Amazon AWS EC2.","category":"page"},{"location":"quickstart/#Table-of-Contents","page":"Quick Start","title":"Table of Contents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"quickstart/","page":"Quick Start","title":"Quick Start","text":"Pages = [\"quickstart.md\"]\nDepth = 2:3","category":"page"},{"location":"quickstart/#Quick-Start-using-Git","page":"Quick Start","title":"Quick Start using Git","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"quickstart/","page":"Quick Start","title":"Quick Start","text":"Download data from RWCodeData to RWCodeLocal directory.","category":"page"},{"location":"quickstart/","page":"Quick Start","title":"Quick Start","text":"tip: Recommended File Structure\nRWCodeLocal/\n├── Data/                   # Data downloaded from RWCodeData\n    └── ...                \n├── Guesses/                # Data downloaded from RWCodeData\n    └── ...\n├── Results/                # Empty folder for saving output results\n└── RWCode/                 # Code from RWCode.jl\n    └── src/\n        └── functions/\n        └── ...
